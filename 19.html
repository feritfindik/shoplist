      <h2>What It Is</h2>
      <p>A compact, battery-powered rechargeable inflator with a 4500mAh (14.8V / ~66Wh) battery, brushless high-speed motor (advertised 80,000 r/min) and dual-stage inflation capable of up to 20 PSI. It weighs ~900 g, measures about 143 x 137 x 67.5 mm, charges via USB-C (QC3.1 supported), and has auto-off at set PSI plus an auto-off deflate function.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Buy</h2>
      <p>Extremely portable and truly cordless — it fits in a small dry bag and recharges, letting you inflate/deflate SUPs, kayaks, tents and wings without access to mains or a car. The brushless motor and dual-stage design deliver fast initial volume then a high-pressure finish, saving time and effort compared with hand pumps and larger corded inflators.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Not Buy</h2>
      <p>Not ideal if you routinely inflate large high-pressure boards (12'6" or very frequent 20 PSI sessions) because the small unit runs hot in sustained high-pressure use and long-term durability under heavy high-PSI duty is a concern. Also it does not include a wall charger and can be quite loud in its high-pressure/second stage.</p>

      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Usage Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the dual-stage workflow: start on low/high-volume to quickly get bulk inflation, then switch to high-pressure to finish to target PSI and let auto-off stop the pump.</li>
        <li>Bring a 30W (or higher) USB-C PD charger for reasonable recharge times; low-power phone chargers will charge extremely slowly.</li>
        <li>If the included gaskets don’t seal your valve, try the gasket from your hand pump or try the set of provided washers to improve the seal.</li>
        <li>Avoid repeatedly inflating large 12'6"/20 PSI boards back-to-back — allow cool-down time between high-pressure runs to reduce heat stress.</li>
        <li>Use the supplied dry bag to carry and keep the pump dry on the water; you can clip/hang the pump while it runs to reduce perceived noise.</li>
        <li>Add a simple inlet filter if you plan to operate on sandy beaches to reduce debris intake (some users reported doing this).</li>
        <li>Tighten adapters fully before inflating — some users found certain fittings require careful seating and a firm screw/lock to avoid leaks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sentiments</h2>
      <h3>Positive</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Truly compact and portable</strong><br>
          Users consistently praise the Pulse Pro's tiny size (about 900 g, palm-sized) and waterproof carry bag, making it easy to carry to shore, pack in a SUP bungee or stow in a backpack. Many reviewers say it replaces larger, corded pumps for day trips and hikes.
          <div class="quote">“This incredibly compact battery powered unit filled my SUP from flat to full 12 PSI in 7 minutes ... The size is really good. It's very compact compared to my other SUP pumps.” - Kevin Photo (Amazon)</div>
          <div class="quote">“It's small and lightweight ... it's so easy to take right to the shore with you so you don't have to lug whatever you're inflating from the car to the shore.” - WTI Gina pump review (YouTube)</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Good battery life for multiple inflations</strong><br>
          The 4500 mAh battery regularly completed multiple inflations on one charge — reviewers and video tests report 2–4 typical inflations (e.g., three 10'6" boards to ~12–15 PSI) per charge depending on board size and target PSI.
          <div class="quote">“It charges fully in about 90 minutes, and provides 2 to 3 uses per charge.” - flyteach (Amazon)</div>
          <div class="quote">“Three boards at up to 15 PSI... that was three boards on one charge. The battery still got three bars left.” - Pulse Pro hands-on review (YouTube)</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fast and powerful inflation</strong><br>
          The brushless motor and two-stage design let the pump inflate boards quickly (many users report 5–10 minutes to reach typical SUP pressures).
          <div class="quote">“It takes about 5 minutes to inflate my paddleboard from zero to 13 PSI.” - Matthew (Amazon)</div>
          <div class="quote">“While we were pumping them up at the lake ... they were so impressed with how quick it was and how convenient it was to not have to plug into a car for power.” - WTI Gina pump review (YouTube)</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Auto-off and deflate features save effort</strong><br>
          <div class="quote">“The initial inflation goes pretty quickly... Deflating takes very little time, and the pump does a great job removing all air so you can store the board easily.” - The Goode Life Outdoors (Amazon)</div>
          <div class="quote">“It has auto shut off once it reaches your set PSI ... once you have deflated your craft using it it will auto shut off so you don't have to do that manually.” - WTI Gina pump review (YouTube)</div>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Negative</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Loud in high-pressure (second) stage</strong><br>
          <div class="quote">“This worked very quickly and quietly until the SUP ... reached 1 psi. As soon as there was any back pressure the pump changed sounds and got very loud ... it also made the tube very hot!” - D'Anemone (Amazon)</div>
          <div class="quote">“It changes sound and goes into high pressure pumping mode.” - Pulse Pro hands-on review (YouTube)</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heat buildup and strain on heavy high-PSI jobs</strong><br>
          <div class="quote">“It pumped my 14' SUP in 10.3 minutes and produced 96 decibels at one meter. The hose got so hot I could no longer touch it.” - Amazon Kunde (Amazon, translated from German)</div>
          <div class="quote">“Any of these small Q pumps we've tried ... they all seem to fall apart when you do a 12'6 board that inflates to 20 PSI.” - Pulse Pro hands-on review (YouTube)</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Some reliability / early-failure reports</strong><br>
          <div class="quote">“This worked really well… twice! We only use it once in a while so it is outside the return date by a week. It won’t charge it won’t turn on. I tried contacting the seller with absolutely no response.” - Cindee (Amazon)</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No charger included / slow charging without PD adapter</strong><br>
          <div class="quote">“It doesn't come with a charger. ... You are really gonna want a 30W charger or you need to be 1000% certain that you aren't gonna need to use it more than once a day.” - Jon Allen (Amazon)</div>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mixed</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Adapters and sealing can require trial and error</strong><br>
          <div class="quote">“I wasn't getting a good seal with the provided gaskets, and finally used the gasket from the hand pump that came with the board, and it sealed great.” - The Goode Life Outdoors (Amazon)</div>
          <div class="quote">“I needed something that could inflate my tent ... this also comes with a variety of adapters which I found so awesome because I needed something that could inflate my tent ... I had to find the one that works.” - Wing inflation how-to (YouTube)</div>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Compared Against</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Outdoor Master Shark 2 / Shark 3:</strong> The Pulse Pro is far smaller and more portable than the Shark pumps; it inflates typical 10'–11' boards faster for single trips but the larger Shark units may dissipate heat better for repeated 20 PSI jobs.</li>
        <li><strong>Cachalot 2:</strong> Users say Pulse Pro is more compact and often quieter during stage 1 than older Cachalot models and delivers comparable or faster inflation for mid-size SUPs.</li>
        <li><strong>Puffer Pro / other mini high-pressure pumps:</strong> Pulse Pro is reportedly smaller than many previous mini pumps but matches or exceeds inflation speed for 10'–11' boards; like other tiny high-pressure pumps, it shares limits on sustained 20 PSI use.</li>
        <li><strong>Larger plug-in/12V SUP pumps:</strong> Compared with corded/12V pumps, Pulse Pro offers cordless convenience and portability but lacks the ability to run directly from a car socket and may not be as durable for repeated high-PSI jobs.</li>
